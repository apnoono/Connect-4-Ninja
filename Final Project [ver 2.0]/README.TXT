
PROJECT TITLE: Udacity Intro to Java Final Project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Given GUI and Connect4Game class documentation, implement the MyAgent class as a subclass of the abstract Agent class.  MyAgent should implement logic to win ConnectFour consecutively against predefined agents of varying skill levels.
DATE: 10/16/2015
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Like all Java programs, Connect-4-Ninja is driven by the main method, which exists inside the Main class.
AUTHORS: Andrew P. Noonoo
USER INSTRUCTIONS: After running Main, a Java applet window serves as the primary interface.  By default, user color is set to red, but can be modified via the myAgent class. You can click through to watch each move, or see an automated outcome as the Connect-4 Ninja demolishes the competition!
